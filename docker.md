## Step 6: Deploying the Application


### Option 1: Run Locally with Docker to connect to GCP Storage Drive

1. **Run the Docker Container Locally**:
   - Build the Docker image:
     ```bash
     docker build -t no-code-architects-toolkit .
     ```
   - Run the Docker container:
     ```bash
     docker run -p 8080:8080 \
        -e API_KEY=<set-to-any-value> \
        -e GCP_BUCKET_NAME='<name-of-gcp-storage>' \
        -e GCP_SA_CREDENTIALS=<contents-of-json-file-downloaded> \
        no-code-architects-toolkit
     ```
### Option 2: Run Locally with Docker to connect to Google Drive

2. **Run the Docker Container Locally**:
   - Build the Docker image:
     ```bash
     docker build -t no-code-architects-toolkit .
     ```
   - Run the Docker container:
     ```bash
     docker run -p 8080:8080 \
        -e GDRIVE_USER='<email address>' \
        -e GDRIVE_FOLDER_ID='<Folder-ID>'
        -e API_KEY='<set-to-any-value>' \
        -e GCP_SA_CREDENTIALS=<contents-of-json-file-downloaded> \
        no-code-architects-toolkit
     ```
    - Using Google Drive, you have to prepare the shared folder for the Service Account to use. When configuring the Service Account, it produces an email address. Use it to share your Google Drive folder. ![](/images/service-account-email-address.png)
    ![](/images/shared-goodle-drive-image.png)
    - The GDRIVE_FOLDER_ID is the trailing subfolder in the shared folder URL.

## Step 7: Testing the Application

1. **Authenticate**:
   - Make a POST request to the `/authenticate` endpoint:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/authenticate \
     -H "X-API-Key: testkkey"
     ```

2. **Convert Media to MP3**:
   - Make a POST request to the `/convert-media-to-mp3` endpoint:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/media-to-mp3 \
     -H "X-API-Key: testkkey" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "media_url": "https://example.com/mediafile.mp4",
       "webhook_url": "https://your-webhook-url.com/webhook"
     }'
     ```

## Step 8: Monitor and Manage Your Application

1. **View Logs**:
   - View application logs via Google Cloud Console or by attaching to the running Docker container:
     ```bash
     docker logs -f <container_id>
     ```

2. **Cleanup**:
   - Ensure to delete resources you no longer need to avoid unnecessary costs:
     - Delete the service account key file.
     - Delete the GCS bucket if not required.
     - Remove the Docker container and image when no longer needed.


### Step 9: Deploy the Docker Image to Google Cloud Run

   - Once the service is deployed, you’ll see a URL in the Google Cloud Console under your service’s details. This URL is where your service is running.

2. **Test the Endpoints**:
   - Use the provided URL to make requests to your endpoints. For example, to test the `/authenticate` endpoint, use the following command:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST https://your-service-url/authenticate \
     -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key"
     ```

3. **Monitor Logs and Performance**:
   - Use the Google Cloud Console to monitor logs and view the performance of your deployed service. Navigate to **Cloud Run > Logs** to view real-time logs.

### Step 11: Cleanup Resources

1. **Delete the Service**:
   - If you no longer need the service, you can delete it by going to **Cloud Run**, selecting the service, and clicking **Delete**.

2. **Remove Unnecessary Resources**:
   - Delete the GCS bucket or Google Drive folder if no longer required.
   - Remove any remaining Docker images or containers on your local machine.
